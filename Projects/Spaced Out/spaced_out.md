# Description
Given 3 different integer numbers, determine if the difference between the smallest number and the middle number is the same as the difference between the middle number and the largest number. The numbers can be entered in any order. If the differences are exactly the same the program should indicate the numbers are “Spaced Out” otherwise the numbers are “NOT Spaced Out”.

1. Prompt for and accept as input three integers. You do not need to edit this input. Only valid positive integer values will be entered.
2. Read the numbers from the standard input device.
3. You may use a console application or build a simple GUI application for the input and output.
4. Display the output as shown in the Test Data below.
5. Each set of input numbers can be tested by rerunning the application.
6. The judges will enter additional test data not provided below to further test your application.

| Input      |      Data      |
|----------- | -------------- |
| 3, 5, 7    | Spaced Out     |
| 7, 5, 3    | Spaced Out     |
| 7, 3, 5    | Spaced Out     |
| 5, 9, 6    | NOT Spaced Out |
| 10, 10, 10 | Spaced Out     |
| 8, 6, 6    | NOT Spaced Out |
| 6, 8, 6    | NOT Spaced Out |
| 6, 6, 8    | NOT Spaced Out |
